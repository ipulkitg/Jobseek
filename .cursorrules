# Job Portal Project Intelligence

## Project Overview
This is a job portal web application project. The memory bank system is now initialized and ready to capture project evolution.

## Memory Bank Structure
- **projectbrief.md**: Core project requirements and goals
- **productContext.md**: User experience and product vision
- **systemPatterns.md**: Architecture and technical patterns
- **techContext.md**: Technology stack and development environment
- **activeContext.md**: Current work focus and recent changes
- **progress.md**: What works, what's left, and current status

## Key Principles
1. Always read memory bank files at the start of each session
2. Update documentation when significant changes occur
3. Maintain clear context across development sessions
4. Document patterns and decisions as they emerge

## Current State
- Project is in initialization phase
- Memory bank structure is established
- Ready for requirements gathering and development

## Development Notes
- Workspace: /Users/pulkitgarg/second/job_port
- OS: macOS (darwin 24.5.0)
